Note mechanism of action & purpose

Beta blockers: reduce stress response
Androgens: stimulates or controls development of male characteristics
Serotonin receptor antagonists: block seratonin
Antineoplastics: Inhibit or prevent development of neoplasms (cancer)
Enzymes: Protein reaction catalysts
Antianxiety agents: Reduce anxiety
Alpha blockers: block alpha receptors. Used to treat hypertension, etc
Beta-lactamase inhibitors: used in conjunction with beta-lactam antibiotic to extend spectrum of activity
Barbituric acid derivatives: CNS depressants (relaxants, anesthetics, etc)
Analgesics: painkillers
Anesthetics: painkillers
Cephalosporins: beta-lactam antibiotics derived from acremonium (cephalosporium)
